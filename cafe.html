			<h3>Foreword</h3>
			<p class="subhead">
        Exploring café shops in Madrid is my absolute favorite thing to do. I have always been the type who loves working/studying in café shops. So finding a good spot to study in Madrid was almost an imperative for me right upon my arrival to Madrid. While most cafes in the US has a work culture with people using computers in coffee shops, the coffee culture here is very different. Cafes are traditionally hangout spots for friends and families, spots to start your morning with espresso (or café con leche) and newspapers, or to enjoy the afternoon sun. If anything, studying/working is surely not on the list of the functionalities which coffee shops bear and thus they usually don’t even feature free wifi. Luckily, with globalizations and especially influence from the United States, more cafes like the ones in the US emerges in Madrid in recent years. Around the city center, there are a few areas where I visit very often, and in each area, I have found a few good places to go. Here is the list of some of my favorite (lesser-known) spots. <br/>
        <footer>Important disclaimer: I am not a coffee connoisseur. While I have had enough coffee to differentiate the really bad ones from the acceptable qualities to above, the purpose of this article is not to recommend cafes with the best specialty coffee.</footer>

<h3 id="letras">Barrio de las letras (Reina Sofia)</h3>
<h4> ACID café </h4>
<p> This is absolutely one of my favorite cafés in Madrid. It is hiding in a street near paseo de prado that is usually quiet and less frequented by tourists. It has a very modern interior design, with minimum decoration of pieces with clean cut giving out an industrial vibe. The café itself is also quiet, with great selection of coffee beans which they will have a sign telling you the origin of the beans they are using on the day. They also make kombucha themselves so depending on what they are experimenting around the time of your visit, they offer different kinds of kombucha and other types of fermented drinks. </p>
<h4>El patio vertical</h4>
<p> Right on the side of Paseo de Prado next to Caixa Forum. It has good and reasonably priced coffee and on the inside it has lots of plants giving out a garden-like feeling. Because of its convenient location, it is frequented by both locals and tourists, and can get loud from time to time. However, in most of the weekday and even weekend afternoons, I still find it to be a great spot to study.

<p>This 5 mins walk from Museum of Reina Sofia and is actually part of Lavapies. But as it is at most 15 mins walk from Barrio de las letras, I still consider them as in the same area. It is a sister café of Mision café, with modern interior design decorated with light colored planks. It is also hiding in a residential block with very few tourists. People can only end up there because they specifically look for the place, which makes it a perfect place to study. I highly recommend their avocado toast, which is not only really good but also very different from the ones I have ever had. A toasted piece of wheat bread covered by avocado slices, seasoned with a mixture of salt, olive oil, and chili, and finished with chopped green scallions spread evenly on top.</p></div>

<h3 id="mala">Malasaña</h3>
A very busy and touristy neighborhood, so most of the places are crowded at all time. However, there are still places that are suitable for studying/working and people watching at the same time.
<h4>Mision café</h4>
<p>My goto café in the area. I think this says enough of how much I adore this place in a barrio that has millions of great cafes. Sister of Hola café mentioned above, they share a very similar vibe in terms of interior decoration. The small closed patio with plants towards the end of the café makes the shop more breathable and relaxing. It is a little bit outside the proper barrio of Malasaña so it is less frequented and less crowded than other places in the neighborhood, and thus a great place to study. </p>
<h4>HanSo café </h4>
<p>Situated at the heart of Malasaña, HanSo is crowded most of the time. It has cool decorations, high-quality drinks, and seems to have a few healthy brunch selections (I have never tried).  Keep in mind that they have a strict policy regarding the use of computers, which ONLY allows computer usage on one long table, even when the shop is not busy.</p>
<h4>Toma café </h4>
<p>This is actually one of the most mentioned “trendy café” in Madrid on the internet. Almost all the guides I have read recommended this café so it is pretty packed most hours of the day. Their pastry  go on sale at the last hour of the café – 1 euro for each piece of your choice. </p>

<h3 id="chueca">Chueca & Salamanca</h3>

  <h4>Waycup specialty café</h4>
  <p>The location of Waycup café is not particularly convenient to access for me. However, I have found myself making my way to the place many times after the first visit for their fantastic homemade cookies. Their cookies are made of high quality ingredients and they will even heat it up a bit for you before serving. My favorite type is the double chocolate one, it is not too sweet as the ones you’d find in most of the other places, not to mention the supermarket ones, and also has really creamy chocolate chips that will melt in your mouth. The interior decoration makes it a cave like environment but still manages to be very classy and contemporary. It is in a really quiet residential neighborhood very close to Retiro so most of time it is really quiet. I also love the way they serve iced latte. Unlike most places that treat iced latte just as simple addition of espresso, ice, and milk, they will still make a nice cup of hot latte with beautiful pattern on the foam, and then give you an extra glass of ice for you to ice it yourself.</p></div>

<h4>Coffee & Code</h4>
<p>A new café opened in the neighborhood in April 2019. It is attached to Mercado de Barcelo on the quiet side of the street. The owners are a couple of Tech consultants from Chile, and thus the name Coffee & Code. Tired from constantly searching for good specialty coffee in the city, they decided to open their own. You’ll quite often see them working on their projects in the shop. However, as the shop is really small, I actually would not recommend studying/working there. They have a few tables outside on the street which makes it perfect for hanging out with friends and enjoying high quality specialty coffee, not to mention they also have IPA so there’s a place for everyone.  </p>
<h4>Lamanca roots</h4>
<p>Situated in Chueca, it is a very trendy café where you can have a variety of healthy food and even snack selections. Their lemonade is a perfect balance of sweet and sour, definitely better than the sugar water you’d get in the supermarket. Chueca is upscale and trendy, so there’s quite an international crowd here who are used to work in cafes and stay-at-home moms who are here to get their healthy after-gym snacks. This also means that Lamanca is really pricy compare to most other places in Madrid. One thing to note is that I had problem with their wifi the time I visited, which I ended up stealing the wifi from Mama Framboise (another great café with French pastry) across the street.</p>
<h4>SantaGloria</h4>
<p>This is a chain that has stores opened mostly in Salamanca (as of mid-2019). It has good quality café at reasonable price, modern and clean design, and most of the time not busy at all. I would definitely recommend this place if you need a coffee to go or sit down to study.</p>
